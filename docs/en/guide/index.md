# Getting started with Minecraft

Hello, My friend, Welcome to the Minecraft community!

Minecraft is an old game with a history of 15 years, and there are countless resources around this game.

I believe you must have encountered the following problems:

```text
I changed to a new computer. Should I continue to use PCL or try other launchers?
I tried Linux but couldn't find a usable launcher?
I want to find an integrated package to play with my friends, but I don't know where to find it?
......
```

Therefore, in order to solve this pain point, OSCSMC (Minecraft One-Stop Community Solution) was born.

## What is this website for?

We have collected common launchers, resource websites, and even server-side and development resources needed by server owners and developers.

Our goal is to reduce the time you spend looking for suitable resource websites, so that you can have more time to concentrate on playing Minecraft.

## How should I use this website?

See the list on the right? It lists everything you need.

## I also want to contribute to this website.
