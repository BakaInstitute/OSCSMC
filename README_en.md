### Precautions

Please [fork](https://github.com/BakaInstitute/OSCSMC/fork) this repository first, and then make changes to the documentation.

This document is formatted under [W3C Requirement for Chinese Text Layout](https://www.w3.org/International/clreq/), please be mindful of the formatting when contributing content.

Note: Anywhere except for non-log information, if there is a mix of Chinese text, English words, and Arabic numerals, add spaces between them; If there is a slash, add a space to each side of the slash. As:

- Baka Infinity Hub (原 Baka Institute) 是一个独立且开放的组织，致力于帮助任何富有互联网探索精神的人。
- `Java 17 Pre`

In principle, English words need to be capitalized, and in some cases, they need to be capitalized according to the rules, and the first letter of English sentences should be capitalized. As:

- Minecraft
- OptiFine
- What you love is your life.

When it comes to paths, add spaces before and after the paths.

Example: 'Path D:/PCL/.minecraft/mods is where the mods are kept'

When it comes to any off-site links, prioritize adding official links and try to avoid unnecessary third-party links.
